# Cinema 4D Resources Syntax

These are (very rough) syntax definitions for the *.res and *.str files used for defining the interfaces of Cinema 4D plugins ([explained here](https://developers.maxon.net/docs/cpp/2025_2_0a/page_manual_resource_files.html)).
There are both TextMate and .vim syntax files which should give compatibility across most common editors and IDEs.
